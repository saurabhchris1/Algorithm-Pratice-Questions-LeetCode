# You have a map that marks the location of a treasure island. Some of the map area has
# jagged rocks and dangerous reefs.
# Other areas are safe to sail in. There are other explorers trying to find the treasure.
# So you must figure out a shortest route to the treasure island.
#
# Assume the map area is a two dimensional grid, represented by a matrix of characters.
# You must start from the top-left corner of the map and can move one block up, down,
# left or right at a time. The treasure island is marked as
# X in a block of the matrix. X will not be at the top-left corner. Any block with
# dangerous rocks or reefs will be marked as D.
# You must not enter dangerous blocks. You cannot leave the map area. Other areas O are
# safe to sail in. The top-left corner is always safe.
# Output the minimum number of steps to get to the treasure.
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
# [['O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],
#  ['D', 'O', 'D', 'O'],
#  ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],
#  ['X', 'D', 'D', 'O']]
#
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Route is (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0) The minimum route
# takes 5 steps.
