# You are given a very large integer n, represented as a string,​​​​​​
# and an integer digit x. The digits in n and the digit x are in the inclusive range [1, 9],
# and n may represent a negative number.
#
# You want to maximize n's numerical value by inserting x anywhere in the decimal
# representation of n​​​​​​. You cannot insert x to the left of the negative sign.
#
# For example, if n = 73 and x = 6, it would be best to insert it between 7 and 3, making n = 763.
# If n = -55 and x = 2, it would be best to insert it before the first 5, making n = -255.
# Return a string representing the maximum value of n​​​​​​ after the insertion.

# Input: n = "99", x = 9
# Output: "999"
# Explanation: The result is the same regardless of where you insert 9.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = "-13", x = 2
# Output: "-123"
# Explanation: You can make n one of {-213, -123, -132}, and the largest of those three is -123.
